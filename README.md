# Electron Native Plugin Samples
This repository contains [ElectronNativePlugin](https://github.com/evonox/electron-native-plugin) samples 
showing how to run and embed C++ native modules into the Electron Applications bundled by **WebPack**.

The samples in this repository:
+ [**hello-world**](https://github.com/evonox/electron-native-plugin-samples/tree/master/hello-world) - 
this is the simplest sample showing the minimal configuration for WebPack 
to compile and run a native module in an Electron app.
+ [**angular-hello-world**](https://github.com/evonox/electron-native-plugin-samples/tree/master/angular-hello-world) - 
this is a more sophisticated example of the integration of Angular, Electron and Webpack using 
the [electron-angular-webpack](https://github.com/lbassin/electron-angular-webpack) kit.
